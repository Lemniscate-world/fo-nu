## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-15

### Added
- Initial project setup with Flutter framework
- Basic UI structure with Material Design theme
- Floating button implementation for clipboard monitoring
- Placeholder functions for audio transcription and Ewe translation
- Integration with `flutter_overlay_window` for overlay functionality
- Integration with `share_plus` for handling shared files
- Integration with `path_provider` for file path management
- Basic clipboard monitoring functionality
- Android manifest configuration for share intents
- Support for receiving audio files from other apps (WhatsApp)
- File type checking for supported audio formats (.mp3, .m4a, .aac, .ogg)
- Asynchronous processing pipeline for shared files
- Placeholder UI for displaying translated text

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Future-based Functions**: Implemented asynchronous functions using Dart's Future API
  - `handleSharedFiles()`: Processes files shared from other apps
  - `transcribeAudio()`: Placeholder for audio transcription functionality
  - Both functions use async/await pattern for clean asynchronous code

- **XFile Handling**: Added support for cross-platform file representation
  - Processing of `List<XFile>` objects from share intents
  - Extraction of file paths and properties
  - Platform-independent file access

- **Variable Management**: 
  - Used `final` keyword for immutable variable declarations
  - Implemented proper scoping for shared data
  - Created clear data flow from file receipt to processing

- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - Implemented `await` operations for sequential processing
  - Added proper error handling structure
  - Ensured UI responsiveness during file processing

- **Share Intent Handling**:
  - Added route checking for share intents (`/share`)
  - Implemented `Share.getInitialFiles()` for retrieving shared content
  - Set up callback system for processing files

- **Flutter Initialization**:
  - Added `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` for proper plugin setup
  - Implemented correct startup sequence for overlay functionality
  - Ensured platform channels are available before use

- **Android Configuration**:
  - Updated AndroidManifest.xml with intent filters
  - Added support for `ACTION_SEND` and `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` intents
  - Configured MIME type filtering for audio files (`audio/*`)
  - Set appropriate activity attributes for sharing functionality

### Known Issues
- Transcription functionality is currently a placeholder
- Translation to Ewe is not yet implemented
- UI for displaying translated text needs improvement
- Overlay permission handling needs more robust error checking
- Limited to audio file formats only

### Next Steps
- Implement actual audio transcription using TensorFlow Lite
- Develop Ewe translation engine or API integration
- Improve UI for displaying translated text
- Add support for text sharing from other apps
- Implement caching for better performance
- Add user settings for customization
